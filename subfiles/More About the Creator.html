		<h1>About me</h1>
			<p class="ptxt">I am writing to express my interest in the Web Designer position at your esteemed company. With a passion for coding and technology that began at age 14, I have built a strong foundation in web design, complemented by my recent Web Design Certificate from CTS College of Business and Computer Science.
<br> <br>
		My previous role as an Assistant Electronic Engineer at an electronic store provided me with valuable experience in hardware troubleshooting, customer assistance, and problem-solving. These skills translate seamlessly into my web design practice, where I excel in programming, critical thinking, and troubleshooting. I am particularly proficient in HTML, CSS, and Photoshop, and I am constantly expanding my knowledge by researching the latest trends and developments in web design.
<br> <br>
		What excites me about this opportunity is the potential to gain experience as a full-stack developer, a crucial step toward my long-term career goal of becoming a software engineer. I am determined to contribute my skills and dedication to your team, working hard to achieve success and deliver high-quality digital solutions. My commitment to continuous improvement is evident in my ongoing education, including certificates in Project Management and a current course on Generative AI and LLMs.
<br> <br>
		I am confident that my technical expertise, strong work ethic, and determination to succeed make me a valuable addition to your organization. I am eager to contribute to your projects and collaborate with your team to create exceptional web experiences.
<br> <br>
		Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my background, skills, and aspirations align with the goals of Webdevstt.
